# Stepper Motor Controller with Microstepping and Speed Ramping
 
## About project

This is a Stepper Motor Controller implementation based on dsPIC30F4013 and L298 dual H-bridge motor driver. Controller support microstepping up to 1/32 of full step and adjustable speed ramping (acceleration/deceleration). Project was built using following: 

- Custom built board based on dsPIC30F4013
- MPLAB X IDE (5.15) + XC16 (1.10)  by Microchip
- PICkit 3 In-Circuit Debugger
